# Documentation index

Every file under `docs/`, with one line each. Nothing here is orphaned.

`CLAUDE.md` in the repo root is where to **start** — the curated index, carrying
the rules that bind before any file is opened. **It is no longer the whole
index.** On 2026-09-01 it was split into layered memory: a smaller root file plus
eight directory-level `CLAUDE.md` files that Claude Code loads only when it reads
a file in that subtree (`app/`, `lib/`, `lib/db/`, `lib/email/`,
`components/deck/`, `styles/`, `scripts/`, `docs/`). The root file's own table
names all eight; `docs/CLAUDE.md` is the one governing this directory.

**`ARCHITECTURE.md`** here is the entry point for how a request travels through
the repo and where each `lib/` subsystem lives — route groups, auth gates,
rendering strategy. Its **§7** also absorbed the root file's old `# Subsystems`
prose, so it is now the full subsystem → doc map. Current. Status columns below
are honest: **current** describes the code today, **historical record** documents
a change that already happened, **dormant** is a runbook for a state the site is
not in.

## `database/`

| Doc | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_SCHEMA.md` | Table-by-table and enum-by-enum reference | counts corrected 2026-08-19 (37/32); table detail still dated 2025-12-15 and may lag |
| `MENTOR_MENTEE_DATA_GUIDE.md` | Field-by-field map of the dual-table `form_submissions → profiles → users` chain | current |

## `deployment/`

| Doc | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `EMAIL_AUTHENTICATION.md` | SPF/DKIM/DMARC records, the staged move to enforcement, Mailchimp → Resend runbook | current |
| `WORKSPACE_MAILBOX_CHECKLIST.md` | The Google Workspace side of the 2026-08 mailbox audit — bilingual, for the super-admin | current |
| `MAILCHIMP_CANCELLATION.md` | What cancelling the paid Mailchimp subscription does and does not put at risk — bilingual, for the founder. The account is **not** being deleted, and the file exists largely to keep those two apart | current — carries the 2026-09-02 archive-only decision; the cancellation itself **has not happened** |
| `HUMANITIX_INTEGRATION_SHUTDOWN.md` | Switching off the Humanitix → Mailchimp contact integration — bilingual, for the founder. Why (it wrote 752 non-opted-in ticket buyers into the list), what breaks, and the per-event route-2 import that replaces it | current — decided, **not done**: still connected and writing as at 2026-09-01, and nobody here can press the button |
| `GITHUB_ACTIONS_AND_ACCOUNT.md` | Why `verify.yml` is one job, measured per-workflow cost, why `deploy.yml` cannot reach three billed minutes, the `_gh-…` TXT record that must not be deleted, and the pending GitHub for Nonprofits application | **premise superseded 2026-09-06** — the repository is public, so Actions minutes are free and unmetered and branch protection is on. Carries a banner saying so; the billing analysis is now history, not a constraint |
| `MAINTAINER_HANDOVER.md` | What stops working silently when the sole maintainer leaves — the access inventory, the three unwatched crons, the human obligations no script enforces, and the open loops that need a founder rather than a developer. §10 is the database move off a personal account, done 2026-09-06 (Neon refuses to transfer a Vercel-managed project, so it was a copy); §11 is Cloudinary's removal and why uploads were deliberately left public; §12 is the credential exposure found in git history, what was rotated, and what is still owed. Written 2026-09-05, kept current through 2026-09-06 | current |
| `MAINTAINER_ONBOARDING.md` | The arriving maintainer's first fortnight, written for Tharanee and Lesley by name: the six accesses each with a *proof step* rather than a login that looked like it worked, installing the handover environment file into both `.env` and `.env.local` and why that split has already cost something, the first pull request, how an environment-variable change actually reaches production, and the four-part test that says the handover is finished | current — written 2026-09-10 for that handover and meant to be reused for the next one |
| `CREDENTIAL_INVENTORY.md` | Every environment variable and account: what reads it, where it must be set, who can issue a replacement, whether it can be issued per person, and what happens to it at a departure. Carries the rotation order (the `website@` password before the Resend key, because one is the login for the other) and a break-glass answer per account. **No values** — it records where a secret lives, never what it is | current — the variable census is dated 2026-09-10 and reproducible with the commands it names; a good number of `Issuer` cells are honestly `UNCONFIRMED` and say so |
| `OPERATIONS_RUNBOOK.md` | Symptom-first, for whoever is holding the pager: the site is down, the digest did not arrive, bounces stopped being recorded. Plus the four things `MAINTAINER_HANDOVER.md` diagnosed and had no answer for — the backup policy, the cost picture, the Slack workspace, and who owns a privacy request | current — the backup section records the first backup this project has ever had (2026-09-10) and proposes the policy; the cost table is mostly `UNCONFIRMED` because the repository never recorded it |
| `MAINTENANCE_MODE.md` | `MAINTENANCE_MODE=true` → branded 503 for the whole site | current |
| `VERCEL_ENV_VARIABLES_GUIDE.md` | Setting env vars without silently corrupting them | current |
| `DOMAIN_MIGRATION_2026-06-19.md` | The cutover to `www.shesharp.org.nz`, layer by layer | historical record |
| `MIGRATION_TO_SHESHARP_ORG.md` | The 2026-03-24 move to the org GitHub + Vercel accounts | historical record |

## `development/`

| Doc | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `ADD_EVENTS.md` | Editing events, stats, sponsors, podcasts and press in `lib/data/` | current |
| `AI_SKILLS_GUIDE.md` | Non-technical walkthrough: installing Cursor and the tools, running any of the eleven `.claude/skills/` workflows, and getting your work back into the repo | current |
| `SKILLS_AND_WORKFLOWS_HANDOVER.md` | The handover companion to the guide above, for the two incoming maintainers: which of the eleven skills each of them owns, the committed `state/*.json` ledgers that are the only record of what was ever sent, which skills are switched off in an untracked local settings file, and where the `scripts/` safety boundary now sits. Reads the ledgers rather than the guide's descriptions — several skills turn out never to have been run | current — written 2026-09-10 |
| `EVENT_PLAYBOOK.md` | The one-page version for the whole team — one diagram, one section per team, a copy-paste prompt for every job. **This is what `/internal/event-playbook` serves** | current |
| `INTERNAL_EMAIL_PLAYBOOK.md` | Its sibling for email, for the same non-technical reader: who may be emailed, which system sends what, the approval chain, the frequency cap, and how the list was actually acquired. **This is what `/internal/email-playbook` serves.** It summarises `consent-rules.md`, `EMAIL_RESPONSIBILITY_BOUNDARIES.md` and `MAILCHIMP_CANCELLATION.md` and defers to all three | current |
| `CHATBOT_AI_AGENT.md` | The visitor chatbot: knowledge context, tools, rate limiting | current |
| `CONTENT_RULES.md` | Counting and naming traps; read before publishing a number or a name | current |
| `DECK_SYSTEM.md` | The `/present/*` deck system in full — data model, skins, linter, host controls | current |
| `EMAIL_ADDRESSES.md` | Every `@shesharp.org.nz` address, and which are mailboxes vs sending identities | current |
| `EMAIL_OPERATIONS.md` | The four sending streams, unsubscribe handling, newsletter loop | current |
| `EMAIL_PLATFORM_STATE.md` | The three email platforms — Mailchimp, Resend, Humanitix — in one place: what each holds, which parts are live, the four crossings between them, a dated decision log, and what nobody could establish. **State and history only** — it cites the consent rules, the boundaries and the cancellation runbook rather than restating them | current, dated 2026-09-02 |
| `EMAIL_PLATFORM_STRATEGY.md` | What the Resend plan buys, why the newsletter is self-hosted rather than bought, and AWS SES as a costed future option | decision record, dated 2026-08-28 — **not** a statement of current state; for that read `EMAIL_PLATFORM_STATE.md` |
| `EMAIL_RESPONSIBILITY_BOUNDARIES.md` | Which system sends which mail — subscribers from this repo through Resend, one event's registrants from Humanitix — and the single sanctioned crossing between the two lists | current, decision record |
| `EVENT_FEEDBACK.md` | The `/f/<code>` QR form: codes, rate limiting, digest, anonymisation | current |
| `EVENT_LIFECYCLE_SOP.md` | One regular event end to end for the whole team — the partner conversation, the phase order, who does what, the promotion beats, close-out, and the developer machinery underneath. The reference `EVENT_PLAYBOOK.md` is built from | current |
| `FUNDER_REPORTS.md` | A pointer: the two Typst projects left for `NZ-SheSharp/she-sharp-reports` on 2026-09-01, which data and generators stayed here and why, and the one part that is still this repo's business — the published impact-report PDFs on Vercel Blob that `/resources` links | current, rewritten 2026-09-01 |
| `GEO_SEO_MONITORING.md` | What SEO/GEO surfaces exist, the Search Console properties, the baseline | current |
| `GEO_SEO_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` | Reusable playbook for adding SEO/GEO to a Next.js 15 site | current |
| `GEO_SEO_BACKLOG.md` | Prioritised SEO/GEO follow-ups, ten done and six open | current, live worklist |
| `HUMANITIX_ARCHIVE.md` | The ticketing export: three tiers, and seven ways a number from it goes wrong | current |
| `MAILCHIMP_ARCHIVE.md` | The `She#` audience export: 1,560 subscribed of 3,689, and the suppression register | current |
| `MENTORSHIP_APPLICATIONS_PAUSED.md` | What was hidden on 2026-06-19 and the runbook to re-open | current — the pause is live |
| `NEWSLETTER_SIGNUP_SURFACES.md` | The website's own route-1 sign-up: the eight placements and why each is there, the one shared component and the hedged copy that must not drift, `placement` → the consent sentence, the two-tier rate limit and the NAT'd venue it exists for, and the static-rendering break that exits 0 | current, from 2026-09-01 |
| `PHOTOGRAPHING_MINORS.md` | When a photograph of a child may be published, and the ten already published without a rule | current — two items await She Sharp's decision |
| `PLATFORM_APIS.md` | The Mailchimp and Humanitix API integrations: what each key reaches, what it cannot (so the manual exports continue), the PII boundary enforced by absence, and the runbook | current |
| `PUBLIC_CLAIMS_PROVENANCE.md` | Which published figures have a record behind them and which do not | current |
| `SITE_DATA_HISTORY.md` | Why pre-2023 event data is patchy — background, not rules | current |
| `SLACK_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` | Setting up incoming webhooks and the notification code pattern | current |
| `SLACK_EVENT_EXTRACTION.md` | The `/event` slash command workflow, with the Python scraper as fallback | current |
| `SLACK_APP_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md` | Building a Slack app on this codebase — decisions and traps | current |
| `TESTING.md` | What CI runs and what it does not, the local pre-push list, why `check-facts.ts` and `verify-page-metadata.ts` are deliberately outside CI, and the two guards that read as correct while gating nothing. Split out of the root `CLAUDE.md` on 2026-09-01 — **the file to change when a check moves**; `ARCHITECTURE.md` §8 is the same CI steps in summary | current |
| `QA_REPORT_FIXES.md` | Item-by-item response to the April 2026 external QA sweep | historical record |
| `batch-import-mentors-2026.md` | The 2026-03-19 one-off import of 25 pre-approved mentors | historical record |

## `features/`

| Doc | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `AI_MATCHING_SYSTEM.md` | How GPT scores mentor/mentee compatibility, with the queue and admin review | current |
| `QR_CODE_GENERATION.md` | The two QR paths — `/api/qr` + print script, and the separate deck codes | current |
| `TEST_USER_ISOLATION.md` | `is_test_user`, test invitation codes, analytics exclusion, cleanup script | current — **authoritative** for this subject |
| `RESTORE_MENTEE_PAYMENT.md` | How to put the $100 mentee Stripe step back; disabled March 2026 | dormant runbook |

## `superpowers/`

Three March 2026 planning documents written for an agent to execute. The work
**shipped** — `ensureUserVerified()`, `maskEmail()` and the `isTestUser` queue
filters are all in the code — but the checkboxes were never ticked, so the files
read as open plans. Design records, not TODOs.

| Doc | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `specs/2026-03-31-auth-edge-cases-optimization-design.md` | Design for seven auth edge cases found after a dual-account incident | historical record |
| `plans/2026-03-31-auth-edge-cases-optimization.md` | The task-by-task plan for that design | historical record, shipped |
| `plans/2026-03-29-test-user-isolation-completeness.md` | Plan to extend test-user badges and filters across admin views | historical record, shipped — superseded by `features/TEST_USER_ISOLATION.md` |

## `marketing/`

Dated campaign artifacts, not engineering documentation. `2026-07-23-ai-driven-she-sharp/`
holds one LinkedIn post: `NOTES.md` (what was made and how), `post.txt` (the copy),
`visual.html` and `visual.png` (the 1080×1080 square).

## `showcase/`

**Not prose — 13 MB of binaries.** The images and video the root `README.md`
embeds between its `SHOWCASE:START` markers: `hero.webp`, `events-full.webp`,
`mentorship.webp`, `mobile-home.webp`, `demo.gif`, `demo.mp4`, plus
`showcase.scenario.json`, the capture script that regenerates them. Do not delete
them, and do not hand-edit the README block — edit the scenario and re-run.

## Adding a doc

From `CLAUDE.md`: **no proactive documentation** — do not create `.md` files
unless asked. When asked, they go under
`docs/{deployment,development,database,features}/`, never the repo root.
`ARCHITECTURE.md` is the one deliberate exception and stays at `docs/` root.

`docs/CLAUDE.md` is the third file at this root and is not documentation: it is
the directory-level instruction file Claude Code loads when it reads anything
under `docs/`, and it says the same thing this section does, at the moment a
model is about to write a file here. Adding a doc means adding its row above —
"nothing here is orphaned" is a claim this file has to keep earning.
