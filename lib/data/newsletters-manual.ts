/**
 * Manually-maintained newsletter issues.
 *
 * This is the ONLY file to edit when a new monthly newsletter goes out.
 * Add a new entry to the array below — the cover image is generated
 * automatically from `month` + `year`, so no design or image upload is needed.
 *
 * To add the next issue, copy this template into NEWSLETTER_MANUAL:
 *
 *   {
 *     id: "2026-09",        // "YYYY-MM" (zero-padded month) — must be unique
 *     month: 9,             // 1-12
 *     year: 2026,
 *     url: "/resources/newsletters/2026-09",   // always on-site (see below)
 *     // theme: 0,          // optional: pin a cover color (0-5); omit to auto-rotate
 *   },
 *
 * `url` used to mean "the Mailchimp campaign link". It no longer does: every
 * card opens `/resources/newsletters/<id>` on this site, served by
 * `app/(site)/resources/newsletters/[issue]/route.ts`. Mailchimp documents
 * nothing about what happens to a hosted campaign page once the subscription is
 * cancelled, and the founder is cancelling it, so 51 links to `mailchi.mp` were
 * 51 ways for the back catalogue to disappear.
 *
 * An issue sent from Mailchimp names the archived send in `campaign`, and keeps
 * the URL it was published at in `source`. An issue composed here rather than
 * in Mailchimp has neither: `/resources/newsletters/<id>` renders it from
 * `lib/newsletter/issues-registry.ts`. Add the fixture there, then the card
 * here.
 *
 * Entries here override archive entries with the same id.

  // The issues with no Mailchimp campaign behind them: August and September
  // 2026 were composed in this repo rather than in Mailchimp, so the registry
  // render is the only artefact of each that exists.
  //
  // **Whether an issue has been sent is not recorded here.** This comment used
  // to assert that August "has not been sent — nothing has ever been sent from
  // `newsletter_subscribers`", which stopped being true on 2026-08-31, when
  // that issue went to 1,549 people in 16 chunks. Nobody updated the sentence,
  // because nothing makes a prose claim in a data file go red when it expires.
  // The send record lives in the skill's ledger
  // (`.claude/skills/monthly-newsletter/state/issues.json`, read it with
  // `issue-ledger.ts show --issue <id>`), which is written by the send itself.
  // Ask it, not this file, and do not re-add a send-status claim here.
  //
  // The missing `campaign` says only that there is no Mailchimp send to serve.
  // See `resolveIssue()` in `lib/newsletter/archive.ts`, which prefers the send
  // wherever there is one, because the other two registry fixtures are drafts
  // of issues that did go out from Mailchimp. The route stays `noindex` and out
  // of `app/sitemap.ts` — it is linked from here, not published to search.

  // Also a correction rather than a new issue, and the one the archive file's
  // header left open ("February 2025 is unresolved ... Needs a human to check
  // the send date in Mailchimp"). Checked on 2026-09-02, and it is the February
  // issue on five independent readings:
  //
  //   1. `newsletter-archive/index.json` puts the send at 2025-02-28.
  //   2. Mailchimp's own internal campaign title is "February 2025" — the
  //      subject line, "We are back for 2025", names no month, which is how the
  //      legacy site came to guess one.
  //   3. The preheader reads "Check out what we got lined up in March".
  //   4. The body cites news dated 2025-02-18 and 2025-02-20.
  //   5. #monthly-newsletter opens this cycle on 2025-02-24, worries on 02-27
  //      that "we need to send it today/tomorrow", and sends on 02-28. The
  //      strings "January 2025" and "Jan 2025" appear nowhere in the channel.
  //
  // And there is no January issue to displace: Mailchimp sent nothing at all in
  // January 2025. So this is the same card under its right month, not a second
  // one — `2025-01` is retracted below, which is what moves the URL with it.

/**
 * Archive entries that must not render — either because they were never real
 * issues (`2026-02`), or because the issue is real but the crawl filed it under
 * the wrong month and it renders correctly from `NEWSLETTER_MANUAL` above
 * (`2025-01`, served as `2025-02`). Both need the same thing: the card gone and
 * the URL with it. Do not read a retraction as "this issue does not exist".
 *
 * `newsletters-archive.ts` is a frozen crawl of the legacy site and is not
 * hand-edited, so a card that should never have existed is suppressed here
 * instead — the crawl stays faithful and the correction stays visible and
 * reversible.
 *
 * Retraction now also decides a URL. `2026-02` still carries the March 2026
 * campaign in `campaign`, because that is what the legacy site linked, but
 * `lib/newsletter/archive.ts` builds its id -> campaign map from
 * `getAllNewsletters()`, so `/resources/newsletters/2026-02` is a 404 and the
 * hex URL for that campaign resolves to `/resources/newsletters/2026-03`. One
 * list suppresses the card and the route together; the guard checks it.
