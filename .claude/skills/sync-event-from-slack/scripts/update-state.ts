/**
 * Atomically record one channel's sync state into the committed manifest
 * (state/sync-state.json). Keeps Claude from hand-editing the manifest, and
 * computes the deterministic content fingerprint from events-custom.json so the
 * next run can short-circuit unchanged events to a no-op.
 *
 * The watermark + thread map come straight from a fetch-channel.ts payload via
 * --from, so the normal flow is:
 *
 *   npx tsx .../fetch-channel.ts <ch> --state > out.json
 *   # …sync the event into events-custom.json…
 *   npx tsx .../update-state.ts --from out.json --mapping event --slug <slug> --event-id <id>
 *
 * Mapping forms:
 *   --mapping event  --slug <slug> --event-id <n>            (repeatable for multi-event channels)
 *   --mapping skip   --reason "<why>" | --reason-file <path>
 *   --mapping none
 *
 * OMIT --mapping to KEEP the channel's existing mapping untouched — reason,
 * events and always-read included. That is the safe default for a plain "record
 * that I have read this" write, and it means re-recording a mapped channel no
 * longer requires echoing its mapping back on the command line. Use
 * `--mapping none` to actually clear one.
 *
 * Batch:
 *   --batch <file.json>          an array of argv arrays, applied in one process
 *                                against one loaded manifest. All-or-nothing.
 *
 * Other flags:
 *   --from <fetch-output.json>   pull channel id/name, watermark, threadState
 *   --channel <id> --name <n> --watermark <ts>   (manual, when no --from)
 *   --type event|general         (default: inferred from name)
 *   --commit <sha>               record the commit that carried this sync
 *   --read-source "<text>"       qualify this receipt: the position is recorded,
 *                                but the claim is narrower than "somebody read
 *                                every message". Use for bulk registration.
 *   --digest "<text>"            sediment what was understood this run (event
 *                                state + open items); carried back next run so
 *                                Slack isn't re-read. Repeat to read from a file
 *                                with --digest-file <path> instead. Omit to keep
 *                                the prior digest; --digest "" clears it.
 *
 * WHAT A DIGEST MAY CONTAIN. For a public channel it is committed to a **public
 * repository**, so write the state, not the conversation:
 *
 *   - state and open items       what the event is, what is decided, what is
 *                                outstanding, what to check first next run
 *   - NOT a person's movements   "cannot make the 8th" is state; where they are
 *                                instead is not
 *   - NOT a quoted message       paraphrase the decision, never the sentence
 *   - NOT an email address       anyone's, including a partner organisation's.
 *                                `state-lib.test.ts` fails CI on one
 *   - NOT an access or door code the standing redaction rule, unchanged
 *
 * Naming somebody in an operational note is fine — the founder's name is on the
 * website. Recounting what they said in a channel is not, and the line between
 * those two is the whole rule.
 *
 * A DM or group DM never reaches the tracked file at all: `saveManifest()`
 * routes it to the gitignored `sync-state.local.json`, because a DM read
 * position is personal to whoever holds the user token and is meaningless to
 * anybody else. See the note on `LOCAL_STATE_PATH` in state-lib.ts.
