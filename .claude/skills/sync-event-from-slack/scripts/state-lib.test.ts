/**
 * Read-position rules for the Slack sync skill.
 *
 * Run: npx tsx .claude/skills/sync-event-from-slack/scripts/state-lib.test.ts
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. On 4 August 2026 six replies landed on a thread whose
 * parent already sat below the channel's watermark. The delta fetch returned
 * nothing, the triage table called the channel quiet, and the state writer
 * recorded every one of those replies as read. They carried the event owner's
 * thirteen-item review of a deck due on a projector three days later, and the
 * only reason anyone found them was that a human pasted the Slack permalink.
 *
 * Every assertion below fails against the code as it stood that morning. The
 * two rules they encode — an absent record means unread, and a read receipt may
 * only describe what was actually read — are not obvious from either call site,
 * which is exactly why they live in one function with one test rather than in
 * two hand-written copies that drifted apart.
