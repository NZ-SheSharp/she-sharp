/**
 * Turn `.cache/triage.json` into something the whole team sees.
 *
 *   npx tsx .../triage-report.ts            # print the issue body, touch nothing
 *   npx tsx .../triage-report.ts --issue    # create or update the standing issue
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 *
 * Reading Slack was one person's job because knowing WHEN to read it was one
 * person's job. `discover-channels.ts` answers that in about a minute, but its
 * answer lands on the terminal of whoever ran it, and running it needs a token
 * and a checkout. So the scheduled workflow runs the triage and this script puts
 * the result where all seven collaborators already look: one standing GitHub
 * issue labelled `slack-triage`, edited in place.
 *
 * THE THREE RULES IT FOLLOWS
 *
 * - **It reports; it never records.** The workflow passes `--no-record`, so no
 *   read position moves and nothing here writes the manifest. A row therefore
 *   keeps nagging until a human actually syncs it, which is the point. A machine
 *   that advanced a read position is the failure mode behind every miss in this
 *   skill's history.
 * - **One issue, edited in place, and a comment only when the set CHANGES.**
 *   The body is state and can be rewritten daily for free; a comment is a
 *   notification to seven people. Posting one for an unchanged backlog is how a
 *   channel becomes something everybody mutes. The current set's hash rides in
 *   an HTML comment in the body, so the comparison needs no extra storage.
 * - **It says what the scan could not see.** `unenumerated` in the triage file
 *   carries the conversations the identity never listed. On the bot token that
 *   is 28 DMs and group DMs plus any private channel nobody invited the bot to,
 *   and 9 of those DMs are `alwaysRead`. An issue that showed only the rows
 *   would read as full workspace coverage.
 *
 * A BACKLOG IS NOT A BUILD FAILURE. This exits 0 whether or not anything needs
 * attention; only a genuine fault (no triage file, `gh` failing) is non-zero. A
 * workflow that goes red because somebody posted in Slack trains people to
 * ignore red.
 *
 * stdout is the issue body. Diagnostics go to stderr, like every script here.
